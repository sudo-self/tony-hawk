## git clone https://github.com/sudo-self/tony-hawk.git
### Everything is here except the game because its 700mb<br>
### Game: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lq1ttqz4wsqwtkln1d7uu/tp.bin?rlkey=guulaj8haqge5hhmi52nqdbyk&dl=0
### download the game and add the "tb.bin" to the root directory then your g2g<br>

You can host the gamefile online, if so then you would just change where the emulator looks to load from. It is currently set to root so you would just swap out the "tp.bin" in quotes with the URL of your ps1 game.<br>

gameURL = 'tp.bin'  to gameURL = 'https://yourGAMElocation'
