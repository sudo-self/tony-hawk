## git clone https://github.com/sudo-self/tony-hawk.git
### Everything is here except the game because its 700mb<br>
### Game: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lq1ttqz4wsqwtkln1d7uu/tp.bin?rlkey=guulaj8haqge5hhmi52nqdbyk&dl=0
### add the "tb.bin" to the root directory then your g2g, You can host the gamefile online, if so then you would just change where the emulator looks to load from. its currently set to root just swap out the "tb.bin" in quotes with the URL of your ps1 game. for loading times and best performance keeping the game in the root file is a best practice.
